# Brainzig
A simple [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter I hacked together in Zig.  
I saw a short brainfuck program, which my brain—surprise surprise—didn't parse very well, so I
wrote an interpreter to read it for me.  
The program is included as `hi.bf`, so you can run `brainzig hi.bf`, or `zig build run -- hi.bf`
to test it out!
